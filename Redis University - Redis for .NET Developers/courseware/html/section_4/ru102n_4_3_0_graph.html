<h1>Working with Graph Data in .NET</h1>

<p>
    Another feature of Redis Stack is the ability to work with Graph Databases. There are a few ways that 
    you can interact with Graph Databases in Redis Stack:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>NRedisGraph: another extension library based on StackExchange.Redis wrapping the Redis Graph Commands</li>
    <li>You can use the Ad-Hoc API to send Graph Commands Directly</li>
    <li>NRedisStack: A newer library based on StackExchange.Redis which provides access to all the commands in Stack</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In this section, we'll work with NRedisGraph to run our commands and use the results of some basic Graph Queries.
