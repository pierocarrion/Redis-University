<h1>Hands-On with Aggregations in Redis OM</h1>

<p>
    In this hands-on we'll learn how to use aggregations with Redis OM .NET. This section will revolve around the <span class="code">AggregationSet&lt;T&gt;</span>
    which is a construct of Redis OM meant to make Aggregations operate fluently.
</p>
<p>
    We'll learn how to query things in Redis using aggregations,
    how to run functions against our data in Redis, how to group our records together by attributes, and how to run reductions
    on those groups of documents.
</p>

<h2>Minor Model Updates</h2>

<p>
    In order to use a document's field within an aggregation it must be either:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Marked as sortable in the original index.</li>
    <li>Explicitly Loaded into the pipeline.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We'll go over both of these methodologies in this section, but so we don't become overly distracted by this, let's go into our model and
    set a couple of fields as sortable that we had previously left not sortable. 
</p>
<p>
    Specifically in the Sale class, we'll mark both the Total and
    EmployeeId fields as <span class="code">Aggregatable</span> - this is an alias of <span class="code">Sortable</span> - I like to use it because it makes it explicit that we're 
    setting it this way so we can run aggregations on our field:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    [Indexed(Aggregatable = true)]
    public string? EmployeeId { get; set; }

    [Indexed(Aggregatable = true)]
    public int Total { get; set; }
</pre>
</p>

<h2>The <span class="code">AggregationSet&lt;T&gt;</span> and <span class="code">AggregationResult&lt;T&gt;</span></h2>

<p>
    The Aggregations pipeline is all built around the <span class="code">AggregationSet&lt;T&gt;</span>, which is of course a generic that you can apply
    whatever your model is to. However, you'll notice that the return type of all the queries from the <span class="code">AggregationSet&lt;T&gt;</span>
    is <span class="code">AggregationResult&lt;T&gt;</span> rather than whatever the type <span class="code">&lt;T&gt;</span> was that you passed into it. 
</p>
<p>This is critical
    to understanding how to construct queries within the <span class="code">AggregationSet</span>. Aggregations are not meant to pull out model data from your 
    database, rather they are meant to allow you to combine your document data within Redis, and reduce it down to some outputs of your pipeline.
    The <span class="code">AggregationResult&lt;T&gt;</span> contains a <span class="code">RecordShell</span>, which is always null when not in the pipeline, that 
    <span class="code">RecordShell</span> can be used to build expressions for our pipeline.
</p>

<h2>Simple Aggregations: Find Bob's Sales</h2>

<p>
    We've added some code to seed a bunch of sales data into our database. Using aggregations, we can find the sum of a given person's sales.
    We can do that by filtering the sales by those whose employee id is Bob's, and then running a summation on all those records.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var saleAggregations = provider.AggregationSet<Sale>(); // init aggregation set.

    var sumBobSales = saleAggregations.Filter(x=>x.RecordShell!.EmployeeId == bob.Id).Sum(x=>x.RecordShell!.Total);
    Console.WriteLine($"Bob's total sales: {sumBobSales}");
</pre>
