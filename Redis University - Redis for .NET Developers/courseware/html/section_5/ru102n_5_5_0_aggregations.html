<h1>Aggregations with Redis OM</h1>

<p>
    In this section we'll look at another really useful feature of Redis Stack and Redis OM, the ability to aggregate data within your 
    documents together. Aggregations allow you to build pipelines for your documents to perform tasks such as:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Query your Documents the same way you would with a <span class="code">IRedisCollection</span>.</li>
    <li>Apply a variety of mathematical and string functions to your data.</li>
    <li>Group like documents together.</li>
    <li>Run Reductions against groups of documents.</li>
    <li>Further filter documents based off the results in your pipeline.</li>
</ul>
