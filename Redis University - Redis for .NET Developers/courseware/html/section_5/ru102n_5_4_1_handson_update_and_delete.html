<h1>Hands-On Updating and Deleting Documents with Redis OM</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On we'll be exploring how to Update and Delete Documents in Redis OM .NET.
    You can either create your own project to follow along with and connect a <span class="code">RedisConnectionProvider</span>,
    or you can open <span class="code">/src/section_5/section5.4/section5.4.csproj</span> in your IDE.
</p>

<h2>Setting up our Example</h2>

<p>
    In this example, we'll be inserting two employees, Alice and Bob, and we'll add Sales to each of them, and then delete them both.
</p>
<p>
    So let's start off by adding Alice and Bob to Redis, as we would any other document:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var alice = new Employee
    {
        Name = &quot;Alice&quot;,
        Age = 45,
        Address = new Address { StreetAddress = &quot;Elm Street&quot;, Location = new GeoLoc(-81.957, 27.058), PostalCode = &quot;34269&quot; },
        Sales = new List&lt;string&gt;()
    };

    var bob = new Employee
    {
        Name = &quot;Bob&quot;,
        Age = 60,
        Address = new Address() { StreetAddress = &quot;Bleecker Street&quot;, Location = new GeoLoc(-74.003, 40.732), PostalCode = &quot;10014&quot; },
        Sales = new List&lt;string&gt;()
    };

    var bobKeyName = await employees.InsertAsync(bob);
    await employees.InsertAsync(alice);
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Updating Documents with Redis OM</h2>

<p>
    Updating documents with Redis OM revolves around the <span class="code">IRedisCollection</span>, which exposes two methods for this behavior: update
    and save. To perform any updates it's critical that the documents you are trying to update have an Id Field that has a value set, 
    this allows Redis OM to determine what the key that it is updating should be.
</p>

<h3>Update a single Document</h3>

<p>
    Using <span class="code">IRedisCollection.Update</span> allows you to run an update on a single record in Redis. So, if we wanted to add a bunch of
    sales for Bob, we would simply update the Bob record, and call <span class="code">Update</span> on the Redis Collection:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var sales = provider.RedisCollection&lt;Sale&gt;();
    var saleInsertTasks = new List&lt;Task&lt;string&gt;&gt;();
    var random = new Random();
    
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; 500; i++)
    {
        saleInsertTasks.Add(sales.InsertAsync(new Sale
        {
            Total = random.Next(1000, 30000),
            EmployeeId = bob.Id
        }));
    }
    
    await Task.WhenAll(saleInsertTasks);
    
    bob.Sales.AddRange(saleInsertTasks.Select(x=&gt;x.Result.Split(&quot;:&quot;)[1]));
    
    await employees.UpdateAsync(bob);
    
    var bobFromDb = employees.FindById(bob.Id!);
    Console.WriteLine($&quot;Bob has: {bobFromDb!.Sales!.Count} sales&quot;);
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Updating Multiple Documents</h2>

<p>
    You can update multiple documents simultaneously by using the <span class="code">IRedisCollection.Save</span> method. When an <span class="code">IRedisCollection</span>
    is enumerated, it maintains a snapshot of each record that it enumerates. If you update those records after they've been enumerated, and call
    <span class="code">IRedisCollection.Save</span> on the collection, the collection will diff each record's current state against it's snapshot, and update
    the relevant documents accordingly. 
</p>
<p>
    So let's try this in practice, let's increment the age of each person whose name is "Alice":
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    await foreach (var employee in employees.Where(x => x.Name == "Alice"))
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Alice's old age: {employee.Age}");
        employee.Age++;
    }

    employees.Save();

    Console.WriteLine($"Alice's new age: {employees.First(x=>x.Name == "Alice").Age}");
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Deleting Documents</h2>

<p>
    There are two ways to delete Documents in Redis. If your model has an Id field, you can use the <span class="code">IRedisCollection.Delete</span> method,
    passing in the document you want to delete. Redis OM will then remove the document from Redis for you. 
</p>
<p>
    So, let's just try removing Alice from Redis:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    await employees.DeleteAsync(alice);
    Console.WriteLine($"Alice's present in Redis: {await employees.AnyAsync(x=>x.Name == "Alice")}");
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    If our model does not have an Id field on it, we can also use the <span class="code">IRedisConnection.Unlink</span> method, passing in the key name that
    you want to remove. When we inserted Bob before, we collected the key name from the insert, so let's use that to delete him from Redis:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    await provider.Connection.UnlinkAsync(bobKeyName);
    Console.WriteLine($"Bob's present in Redis: {await employees.AnyAsync(x=>x.Name == "Bob")}");
</pre>
</p>
