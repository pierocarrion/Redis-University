<h1>Updating and Deleting Documents with Redis OM</h1>

<p>
    In this section we'll look at how Redis OM performs the "U" and "D" of CRUD: Updates, and Deletes. 
</p>
<p>
    Unlike a traditional
    relational database Redis Stack does not have the the ability to natively query, update, and delete records in isolation on the Redis
    Server, so we need to use the client to do so. Fortunately, Redis OM makes these tasks pretty straightforward as we'll be exploring in
    this section.
