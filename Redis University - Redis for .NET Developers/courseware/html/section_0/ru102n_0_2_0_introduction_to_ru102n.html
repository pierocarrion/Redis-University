<p>Hello and welcome to Redis University. This is RU102N, Redis for .NET Developers.</p>

<p>
    First let me introduce myself. I'm <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/slorello">Steve Lorello</a>, I'm a Senior Field Engineer at Redis and I'm here to help guide you along the way as you dive into using Redis from .NET.
    Before we begin, I want to provide a rough overview of what we'll be covering in this class. This class is all about the interaction of two technologies .NET and Redis.
    In this course we'll learn:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>About the primary client of the .NET ecosystem <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stackexchange/stackexchange.redis">StackExchange.Redis</a></li>
    <li>How to interact with all the data structures you learned about in <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://university.redis.com/courses/ru101/">RU101: Introduction to Redis Data Structures</a> in .NET</li>
    <li>How Redis melds beautifully into some of the core components of ASP.NET and ASP.NET core to handle key use cases such as Caching and Session State Management</li>
    <li>How you can interact with the various extended data structures offered by <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/docs/stack/">Redis Stack</a> in .NET</li>
    <li>How to model, index, and query items in Redis using LINQ and <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/redis/redis-om-dotnet">Redis OM .NET</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Throughout the course I'll have a lot of hands on exercises for you to work through. 
    These sections are not graded, but I highly recommend you invest time in doing each 
    of them. After all, there's no better way to learn than to do.
</p>

<p>
    At the end of this course, you will have the opportunity to complete a final exam. 
    A score of 65% or better will grant you a certificate of completion to add to your 
    LinkedIn profile.
