<h1>The Derived Client Ecosystem</h1>

<p>
    In the .NET Redis Ecosystem, there are a variety of clients that are derived clients of StackExchange.Redis. In this unit we'll be looking
    at a few of them that are specifically built around ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core.
</p>

<p>
    In general the derived clients of StackExchange.Redis take many of the same parameters as StackExchange.Redis does. However there are
    some important exceptions which we'll explore later in this unit. 
</p>
<p>
    In general these clients are configured along with the rest of your application,
    in the case of ASP.NET Core, they are typically best configured at application startup when configuring your application services. 
</p>
<p>
    Both of
    the cases we are going to explore here are heavily integrated into the ASP.NET stack, and you'll be surprised with how simple it is to get
    up and running with them.
