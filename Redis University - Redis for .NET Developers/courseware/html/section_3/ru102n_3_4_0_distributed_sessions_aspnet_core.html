<h1>Distributed Session State in ASP.NET Core</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On, we'll be exploring how to use Session State Management in ASP.NET Core.
    You'll likely want to open up the csproj file and check out the <span class="code"><i>starting-point</i></span>
    branch before proceeding, unless of course you'd prefer to build everything from scratch.
</p>
<p>
    The csproj file is located at <span class="code">/src/section_3/section3.4/section3.4.csproj</span>. 
</p>

    Session state is the state maintained between the client's browser and a web server. However as we live in a world of increasingly larger
    distributed systems, we run into a problem. Do we really want the client to be dependent on a single, theoretically stateless application
    server? 
</p>
<p>
    The answer is no, yet this session-state can be absolutely critical for the functionality of some applications. Hence it's often
    really helpful to have a intermediate database act as a central holder for this session state. This pattern is so popular in fact that it's
    heavily integrated into both ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core. 
</p>
<p>
    Since Redis is so often tapped as the database acting as the distributed session
    state store, there are very straightforward integrations to add Redis as a native integration which we'll be exploring throughout the next
    couple of sections.
