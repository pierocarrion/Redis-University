<h1>Redis the ASP.NET Way</h1>

<p>
    We'd be remiss if we went through an entire course about Redis, and did not mention ASP.NET or ASP.NET Core. In this unit we'll be looking
    at two of the more popular integrations of Redis in the ASP.NET ecosystem.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Caching</li>
    <li>Session State Management</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We'll be looking at how to do both of these in both ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core. We'll prioritize core as that's definitely the future of
    the ecosystem, but there are always a distinct possibility that you might be working on an older ASP.NET project that could use an integration.
