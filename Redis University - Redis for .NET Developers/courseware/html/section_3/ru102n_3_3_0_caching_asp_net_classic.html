<h1>Caching in ASP.NET</h1>

<p>
    Before we get started here, just a quick note... the sections on ASP.NET are completely optional, they are here because there are many
    developers still using ASP.NET, so this can be quite useful to them.
</p>
<p>
    But the reality is that ASP.NET is rapidly becoming a largely
    legacy framework with the emergence of ASP.NET Core. So if you don't think the sections on ASP.NET will be useful to you, feel free to skip them.
</p>
<p>
    None of the questions on the exam will involve this material.
</p>

<p>
    Doing simple caching in ASP.NET is the only one of the use cases we'll discuss in this unit that does not involve the use of some derived 
    library. It's a simple enough way to use Redis that one isn't particularly needed (though when you compare it to ASP.NET Core you'll see 
    why a framework integration can be really nice).
</p>

<p>
    In this section, we'll walk through an application with the same model as the ASP.NET Core example, the major differences are that instead
    of using EntityFramework Core, we use EntityFramework, and instead of using ASP.NET Core WebAPI we are using the ASP.NET API scaffolding,
    consequentially the structure of the projects are quite different.

<h2>Additional Prerequisites for this section</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Because this is an ASP.NET section it necessary for you to have a Windows Machine (preferably Windows 10+) to work on. The reality
        of the .NET Framework is that it only runs on Windows, so you'll need Windows.
    </li>
    <li>
        You must have the <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks">.NET Framework 4.8.1 SDK installed</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        The example here uses MS SQL Server Express's <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb?view=sql-server-ver16">LocalDB</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        It's highly recommended that you use either Visual Studio or Rider for this section.
    </li>
</ul>
