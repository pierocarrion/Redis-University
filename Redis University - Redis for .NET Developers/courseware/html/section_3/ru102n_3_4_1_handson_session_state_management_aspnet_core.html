<h1>Hands-On with Session State Management in ASP.NET Core</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On, we'll be exploring how to use Session State Management in ASP.NET Core.
    You'll likely want to open up the csproj file and checkout the <span class="code"><i>starting-point</i></span>
    branch before proceeding, unless of course you'd prefer to build everything from scratch.
</p>
<p>
    The csproj file is located at <span class="code">/src/section_3/section3.4/section3.4.csproj</span>. 
</p>
<p>
    It's highly recommended that you use Visual Studio or Rider for this Hands-On.
</p>

<h2>Review the State of the App</h2>

<p>
    The actual hands-on bit of this is really simple, so before we jump into it, let's take a look at the state of the current state of the
    application. 
</p>
<p>
    If you start the application with <span class="code">dotnet run</span>, you'll see on the home page at <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="http://localhost:5097/">http://localhost:5097/</a>
    that the Session State is telling you the meaning of life is "42". 
</p>
<p>
    This is coming directly out of the Session State. If you look at the 
    <span class="code">Index</span> method of <span class="code"><i>Controllers/HomeController.cs</i></span> you'll see that we are setting the session state to 42 with:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    HttpContext.Session.SetString("meaning of life", fourtyTwo.ToString());
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Meanwhile, on the front-end, our view at <span class="code"><i>Views/Home/Index.cshtml</i></span> - is displaying the meaning of life key within the session with:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    @Context.Session.GetString("meaning of life")
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Finally, In <span class="code"><i>Program.cs</i></span> we have two lines of code:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    builder.Services.AddSession();
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    The above line adds the Session Services to our available services.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    app.UseSession();
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    The above adds the Session State Middleware to acquire the session state to be passed to the controllers that will interact with the session.
</p>
<p>
    These are all the preliminaries for using <span class="code">SessionState</span>. However, in this state, the session is not distributed, so the sessions will not
    be able to persist across different application servers, severely limiting your ability to scale out requests from an individual client.
</p>

<h2>Adding Distributed Session State Storage with Redis</h2>

<p>
    This part's really simple. Ahead of time, I've added:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
        &lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRedis&quot; Version=&quot;7.0.0&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    To the <span class="code"><i>section3.4.csproj</i></span> file, that's the exact same package we used earlier when we discussed using Redis as a Caching Layer for
    ASP.NET Core.
</p>
<p>
    Enabling this as the backing for the session state is as simple as adding the Cache to our services container in that
    previous section. You only need to add the following to the services section of your <span class="code"><i>Program.cs</i></span> section at the mark <span class="code"><i>// TODO Section 3.4 Step 1</i></span>
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    builder.Services.AddStackExchangeRedisCache(options => options.ConfigurationOptions = new ConfigurationOptions{
        EndPoints = { "localhost:6379" },
        Password = ""
    });
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    And that's it, with that done, you can run the app again with <span class="code">dotnet run</span>, and when you launch the application's site at
    <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="http://localhost:5097/">http://localhost:5097/</a>, the session will still work, the only difference is now the server is storing
    the session state in Redis instead of locally. You can even run <span class="code">redis-cli monitor</span> to watch it work with the session state.
