<h1>Hands On with Caching in ASP.NET Core</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On, we'll be exploring how to use Caching in ASP.NET Core.
    You'll likely want to open up the csproj file and checkout the <i>starting-point</i> branch 
    before proceeding, unless of course you'd prefer to build everything from scratch :)
    the csproj file is located at  <span class="code">/src/section_3/section3.2/section3.2.csproj</span> 
    it's highly recommended that you use Visual Studio or Rider for this Hands-On.
</p>
<p>
    Much of the sinew for this is already built, even if you are starting from the start point, we have a
    <span class="code">SalesContext</span> that contains our model, as well as the <span class="code">EntityFramework</span> bits to migrate the database correctly.
    All you need to do to migrate the database to where we need it for this example, is to from the
    <span class="code">/src/section_3/section3.2</span> directory run the following commands:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
    dotnet ef database update
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    The first of these commands will install the dotnet-ef tool for the CLI, the second will create and migrate
    the Database for you.
</p>

<h2>Add Redis to Your Services</h2>

<p>
    After we've migrated the database, we'll need to make sure that we are adding Redis as a caching layer for
    our app. To do this, you'll just need to open <span class="code"><i>Program.cs</i></span>, and find the comment <span class="code"><i>// TODO Section 3.2 Step 1</i></span>
    below that you'll just have the builder add the StackExchange Redis Cache, passing in a function to configure
    StackExchange.Redis.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    builder.Services.AddStackExchangeRedisCache(x => x.ConfigurationOptions = new ConfigurationOptions
    {
        EndPoints = { "localhost:6379" },
        Password = ""
    });
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Adjust the cache settings to your endpoint/password.
</p>

<h2>Clear Cache in Init Service</h2>

<p>
    When the application restarts, we want to reset the items that we are going to cache, as part of this,
    we'll need to open the <span class="code"><i>InitService.cs</i></span>, a hosted service that runs at startup to clean up and re-seed
    the database, we'll need to add some logic to have it clean up the cache as well. We have a scope factory
    already DI'd into this service, so we can pull out the <span class="code">IDistributedCache</span> fairly easily. Then,
    it's a matter of clearing out the relevant records for our app. Add The following code immediately below the
    <span class="code">// TODO Section 3.2 Step 2</span> comment in <span class="code"><i>InitService.cs</i></span>:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var cache = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IDistributedCache>();

    var cachePipe = new List<Task>
    {
        cache.RemoveAsync("top:sales", cancellationToken),
        cache.RemoveAsync("top:name", cancellationToken),
        cache.RemoveAsync("totalSales", cancellationToken)
    };
    cachePipe.AddRange(salesDb.Employees.Select(employee => cache.RemoveAsync($"employee:{employee.EmployeeId}:avg", cancellationToken)));

    await Task.WhenAll(cachePipe);
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Dependency Inject IDistributedCache</h2>

<p>
    With the cache added to our DI container, we will need to inject it into our controller. Open up
    <span class="code"><i>Controllers/EmployeeController.cs</i></span> in there, add the <span class="code">IDistributedCache</span> as a readonly field.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    private readonly IDistributedCache _cache;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Then, modify the <span class="code">EmployeeController</span> constructor to accepted an <span class="code">IDistributedCache</span>, when you're
    done, it should look like this:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    public EmployeeController(SalesContext salesDb, IDistributedCache cache)
    {
        _cache = cache;
        _salesDb = salesDb;
    }
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Employee Aggregations</h2>

<p>
    As we discussed earlier, when the application boots it will randomly seed the database with thousands of records.
    We have some API calls here that will do some aggregating on our employee's sales figures. There's three different
    aggregations we'll be performing.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The Top Salesperson and their sales</li>
    <li>A given sales person's average sales</li>
    <li>The Total Sales of all the salespeople</li>
</ul>

<p>
    None of these, with the relatively small amount of data we're working with (~50,000 records), are particularly
    long running operations - probably on the order of 50-150 ms. 
</p>
<p>
    However, keep in mind that if we need access to
    these types of values repeatedly, we're going to be performing a lot of extra work, and of course, if we're 
    doing anything that involves a UI, even this relatively small latency is pretty rough. That's where Redis comes
    in, we're going to be storing these records in our Redis Cache using the <span class="code">IDistributedCache</span> abstraction.
</p>

<h3>Caching Top Salesperson</h3>

<p>
    Our first task here will be caching the top sales-person. This is a relatively straight forward LINQ query to
    go to SQLite, compute the top sales-person and their sales, and to get the information for our application,
    you can see it already in the <span class="code">GetTopSalesperson</span> method.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var topSalesperson = await _salesDb.Employees.Select(x=>new {Employee = x, sumSales = x.Sales
        .Sum(x=>x.Total)}).OrderByDescending(x=>x.sumSales)
        .FirstAsync();
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Now, realistically, this will take time to compute - somewhere on the order of 50-150 ms for our smallish sample
    here. If we are going to run this operation repeatedly, it'd behove us to do something with this data so that 
    we don't have to go back to our SQL database each time and recompute it.
</p>
<p>
    So, we'll cache it using our
    <span class="code">IDistributedCache</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Find the place marked <span class="code"><i>// TODO Section 3.2 step 3</i></span>, and add the following code to it.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var cacheOptions = new DistributedCacheEntryOptions { AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5) };
    var topSalesInsertTask = _cache.SetStringAsync("top:sales", topSalesperson.sumSales.ToString(), cacheOptions);
    var topNameInsertTask = _cache.SetStringAsync("top:name", topSalesperson.Employee.Name, cacheOptions);
    await Task.WhenAll(topSalesInsertTask, topNameInsertTask);
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    This will add the total sales of the top seller and the their name to the cache, and it will invalidate that
    after 5 minutes. With that done, we need to add some logic up front to check the cache to see if those keys
    exist.
</p>
<p>
    If they do, then we can short circuit the rest of this process, and return those results. Find the mark <span class="code"><i>// TODO Section 3.2 step 4</i></span>
    and add the following above it.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var topSalesTask = _cache.GetStringAsync("top:sales");
        var topNameTask = _cache.GetStringAsync("top:name");

        await Task.WhenAll(topSalesTask, topNameTask);

        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(topSalesTask.Result) && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(topNameTask.Result))
        {
            stopwatch.Stop();
            return new Dictionary<string, object>()
            {
                { "sum_sales", topSalesTask.Result },
                { "employee_name", topNameTask.Result },
                { "time", stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds }
            };
        }
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Cache Individual Average Sale</h2>

<p>
    Next, we'll look at calculating the average sale of a given individual salesperson. To do that we'll have
    and endpoint that takes an Id, which we'll use to run a simple average on their sales like so:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var avg = await _salesDb.Employees.Include(x => x.Sales).Where(x=>x.EmployeeId == id).Select(x=>x.Sales.Average(y=>y.Total)).FirstAsync();
</pre>
</p>

<p>

    Again, we'll want to cache this by setting a key in Redis, find the spot marked <span class="code"><i>// TODO Section 3.2 step 5</i></span>
    and add:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var key = $"employee:{id}:avg";
    var cacheResult = await _cache.GetStringAsync(key);

    if (cacheResult != null)
    {
        stopwatch.Stop();
        return new Dictionary<string, double>
        {
            { "average", double.Parse(cacheResult) },
            { "elapsed", stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds }
        };
    }
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    To create the key that we'll use. Then, underneath the mark <span class="code"><i>// TODO Section 3.2 step 6</i></span>, add the following
    to set that key to the computed average. In this case, we'll set it to have a 30 minute sliding expiration,
    what that means is that the key will persist unless it is not touched for 30 minutes.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    await _cache.SetStringAsync(key, avg.ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture), options: new DistributedCacheEntryOptions{SlidingExpiration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30)});
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Cache Total Sales</h2>

<p>
    Finally, we'll want to cache the total sales that the whole organization created, this is probably the simplest
    of the calculations we're performing as there's no logic beyond summing up all the sales. However this is still
    a linear complexity process, so it'd still behoove us to cache it. So, let's start out by adding our cache 
    checking logic, find the section marked <span class="code"><i>// TODO Section 3.2 step 7</i></span> and add the following:    
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var cacheResult = await _cache.GetStringAsync("totalSales");
    if (cacheResult != null)
    {
        stopwatch.Stop();
        return new Dictionary<string, long>()
        {
            { "Total Sales", long.Parse(cacheResult) },
            { "elapsed", stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds }
        };
    }
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    This might be a metric that you run every day, so let's have it expire at midnight tomorrow morning, below
    mark <span class="code"><i>// TODO Section 3.2 step 8</i></span>, add the following:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    await _cache.SetStringAsync("totalSales", totalSales.ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture), new DistributedCacheEntryOptions(){AbsoluteExpiration = DateTime.Today.AddDays(1)});
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Run the App</h2>

<p>
    All That's left to do now is run the app. To do this, all you need to do that is run <span class="code">dotnet run</span> 
    from the console in the same project as the <span class="code"><i>.csproj</i></span> file. 
</p>
<p>
    Then you can navigate to 
    <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="http://localhost:5053/swagger/index.html">http://localhost:5053/swagger/index.html</a> in your browser
    and you can play with the API.
</p>
<p>
    You'll notice that each of these methods is pretty snappy regardless, but after
    the first try for each, you'll see a latency drop down to about a millisecond on each call (if you are running Redis locally). 
</p>
