<h1>Introducing our Employee Example</h1>
   
<p>
    For our employee aggregations example, we'll keep it simple, we'll have two components of our model, Employees and Sales. They'll
    look like this:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">    
    public class Employee
    {
        public int EmployeeId { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public List&lt;Sale&gt; Sales { get; } = new();
    }

    public class Sale
    {
        public int SaleId { get; set; }
        public int Total { get; set; }

        public int EmployeeId { get; set; }
        public Employee Employee { get; set; }
    }
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    We'll use Entity Framework and a local SQLite database for our example. If you are using a remote Redis Database, keep in mind that you'll
    incur some latency over the network when going to Redis vs going to our SQLite database, so if you want to truly compare apples to apples
    you can either run Redis locally (see the course setup instructions), or you can use a remote SQL Database by updating the adapter we're using in our
    example.
