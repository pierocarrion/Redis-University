<h1>Pipelining</h1>

<p>
    Pipelining is a critically important concept for maximizing throughput to
    Redis. When you need to execute multiple commands against Redis, and the
    intermediate results can be temporarily ignored, pipelining can drastically
    reduce the number of round trips required to Redis, which can drastically
    increase performance, as many operations are hundreds of times faster than
    the Round Trip Time (RTT).
</p>

<p>
    With StackExchange.Redis, there are two ways to pipeline commands,
    either implicitly with the Async API, and explicitly with the <span class="code">IBatch</span> API.
</p>

<h2>Implicit Pipelining with Async API</h2>

<p>
    If you use the async version of a command, the command will be automatically
    pipelined to Redis. If you use <span class="code">await</span> to await the result of a
    task dispatched by one of these async commands, it will wait until the command
    is complete before returning control. However, if you group a set of tasks dispatched
    by the async methods together and await them all in one shot, the <span class="code">ConnectionMultiplexer</span>
    will automatically find an efficient way to pipeline the commands to Redis, so that
    you can cut down the number of round trips significantly.
</p>

<h2>Explicit Pipelining with IBatch</h2>

<p>
    You can also be much more explicit about pipelining commands. The <span class="code">IBatch</span>
    API only provides the async interface for commands. You can set up however many commands
    you want to pipeline with those async methods, preserving the tasks as they will provide
    you the results. 
</p>
<p>    
    When you have all the commands that you want pipelined dispatched,
    you can call <code>Execute</code> to run them all. This will pipeline all of your commands
    in one contiguous block to Redis. Using this method, no other commands will be interleaved
    with your batched commands from the client. However, if there are other clients sending
    commands to Redis, it's possible that their commands will be interleaved with the batched
    commands.
