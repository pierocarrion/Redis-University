    There are of course a variety of ways to Add StackExchange.Redis to your project.
    From the base directory of the github project, first checkout the <span class="code">starting-point</span> tag,
    this will leave you with a skeleton of the projects we are going to build in this course.
    Move to the <span class="code">src/section_1/section1.2</span> directory with <span class="code">cd src/section_1/section1.2</span>.    
</p>
<p>
    This directory contains <span class="code">section1.2.csproj</span>, which is a more or less empty csproj
    file. To Add StackExchange.Redis to this project, follow any of the methods outlined in
    <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/StackExchange.Redis">NuGet</a>, or just run:
    <span class="code">dotnet add package StackExchange.Redis</span>
