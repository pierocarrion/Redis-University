<h1>IDatabase</h1>

<p>
    The <span class="code">IDatabase</span> can be thought of as the primary interactive interface to Redis.
    It provides a single interface for your entire Redis Instance, and is the
    preferred interface when you are executing single commands that manipulate
    your application's data to Redis.    
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">IDatabase</span>, unlike the <span class="code">IServer</span>, abstracts the particulars of your Redis
    deployments away. Consequentially, if you are running in a cluster and are
    preforming a write, the <span class="code">IDatabase</span> does not require you to know which server
    in particular you need to write to. Also, if you have many replicas per master
    shard in your <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/docs/management/scaling/">Cluster</a>
    or <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/docs/management/sentinel/">Sentinel</a> Redis
    deployments, the <span class="code">IDatabase</span> will leverage the <span class="code">ConnectionMultiplexer</span> to
    automatically distribute your reads across your deployment.
