<h1>ITransaction</h1>

<p>
    The <span class="code">ITransaction</span> provides an interface for Redis <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/docs/manual/transactions/">Transactions</a>.
    Transactions in Redis differ from transactions in other databases, for a full
    description of transactions check out the transaction section of
    <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://university.redis.com/courses/ru101/">RU101</a>.    
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">ITransaction</span> interface is fundamentally an async interface. It exposes 
    a very similar command set to the <span class="code">IDatabase</span>, but it will only expose async
    versions of each command. That is because each command in <span class="code">ITransaction</span> is
    async, as they will not be competed until after <span class="code">Execute</span> is called.
    Only after the <span class="code">Execute</span> is called can the underpinning tasks for the
    Transaction be awaited. 
</p>

<p>
    You can get an instance of an <span class="code">ITransaction</span> by calling 
    <span class="code">IDatabase.GetTransaction()</span> on your <span class="code">IDatabase</span> object.
