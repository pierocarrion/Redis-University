    The client ecosystem for Redis is disparate and vibrant. With the exception of the 
    <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/redis/hiredis">hiredis</a> client, the client ecosystem was
    initially built out by the larger Redis community. There are different levels of abstraction
    that Redis clients can provide to users. It's helpful if we try to group those together for
    a conversation about Redis clients. Let's think of them in these groups:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Minimal Protocol Clients:</b> These clients basically handle connection, wrap the 
        <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/">RESP protocol</a> (the wire 
        protocol for Redis) and little else. They're quite minimalist and intended to provide
        maximum control to the user.
    </li>
    <li><b>General Command Level Clients:</b> The clients that directly expose the Redis command
        interface and provide some parsing for the result structures bubbling up from it.
        These have a more or less 1:1 mapping between commands in Redis and commands in the client.    
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Higher Level Abstract Clients:</b> These clients are intended more to provide a
        friendly user interface to developers and provide some meaningful abstraction above the
        Redis command interface and paradigms the users are used to.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Framework Integrations:</b> These clients are written to interact directly with a
        particular framework, often times they implement some very particular functionality in a way native to the framework.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    There are a plethora of clients of each of these breeds throughout the .NET community.
    The one that's had the most consequential impact however is undoubtedly StackExchange.Redis.    
</p>

<p>
    StackExchange.Redis was written by <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://blog.marcgravell.com/">Marc Gravell</a>
    in collaboration with <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://nickcraver.com/">Nick Craver</a> as part of their
    work at StackExchange. Marc had written an older client called <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/BookSleeve">BookSleeve</a>
    which had some <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://blog.marcgravell.com/2014/03/so-i-went-and-wrote-another-redis-client.html">fundamental issues</a> that he sought to address in StackExchange.Redis.
</p>

<p>
    The library falls somewhere between the second and third tier clients, while also leaving
    open a more or less minimalist ad-hoc API that we'll explore in later sections. It's
    best described as that second-tier General Command Level Client of Redis. And it has been
    adapted by the community as such.
</p>

<p>
    Consequentially the .NET Redis community has largely been shaped by this project. All of
    the other third and fourth level libraries we'll be looking at later in this course have
    this Library as a dependency. Consequentially it's important for us to dive into some of the
    fundamentals of the library to see how it works, its benefits, and some of its limitations.
