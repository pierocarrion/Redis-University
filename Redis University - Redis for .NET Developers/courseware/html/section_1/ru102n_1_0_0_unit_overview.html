<p>
    Throughout this unit, I'll have Hands-On materials for you to work through 
    and code to actually let you get your hands dirty. These bits aren't graded,
    but you should ought to work through them all, what better way to learn is there than
    actually writing some code and seeing it work?
</p>
<p>
    By the end of this unit, you'll
    have a firm grasp as to the fundamentals of the StackExchange.Redis library,
