<h1>ISubscriber</h1>

<p>
    The <span class="code">ISubscriber</span> is the interface responsible for maintaining subscriptions
    to Redis in the pub/sub interface. Unlike the other interfaces we've looked
    at thus far, the subscriber does not leverage the interactive connection.
</p>

<p>
    The Multiplexer explicitly opens a separate connection for subscriptions
    because when you subscribe to any channel on a client in Redis, the client
    connection converts to subscription mode. This limits the connection to only use commands that implement subscriber functionality.
</p>

<p>
    True to it's name however, the Multiplexer continues to maintain a single
    connection per server, and all subscriptions are handled on that single
    connection.
</p>

<p>
    You you can get an instance of an <span class="code">ISubscriber</span> by calling the
    <span class="code">IConnectionMultiplexer.GetSubscriber()</span> method.
