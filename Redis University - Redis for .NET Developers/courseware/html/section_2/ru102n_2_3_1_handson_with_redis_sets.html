<h1>Hands-On with Redis Sets</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On we'll be exploring how to use Redis Sets from StackExchange.Redis.
    You can either create your own project to follow along with and connect a multiplexer,
    or you can open <code>/src/section_2/section2.3/section2.3.csproj</code> in your IDE.
</p>

<p>
    In this example we'll be working with 5 sets of users.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>ActiveUsers</li>
    <li>InactiveUsers</li>
    <li>OnlineUsers</li>
    <li>OfflineUsers</li>
    <li>AllUsers</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Let's start out by clearing out the sets we'll be working with from Redis:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var allUsersSet = "users";
    var activeUsersSet = "users:state:active";
    var inactiveUsersSet = "users:state:inactive";
    var offlineUsersSet = "users:state:offline";
    db.KeyDelete(new RedisKey[]{allUsersSet, activeUsersSet,inactiveUsersSet, offlineUsersSet});
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Populate Sub Sets</h2>

<p>
    Now let's go about populating our active, inactive, and offline user sets. To do this,
    we'll use the <span class="code">SetAdd</span> Method. This method is variadic so we can do it in one command for each set.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    db.SetAdd(activeUsersSet, new RedisValue[]{"User:1","User:2"});
    db.SetAdd(inactiveUsersSet, new RedisValue[]{"User:3", "User:4"});
    db.SetAdd(offlineUsersSet, new RedisValue[] {"User:5", "User:6", "User:7"});
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Combining sets to get all users</h2>

<p>
    You'll notice that we did not populate our <span class="code">allUsersSet</span> set. If we consider active, inactive, offline
    to be an exhaustive list of states, we can use the set combination operations to get a
    set with all of our users. We can even use <span class="code">SetCombineAndStore</span> to store those combined users in our all users key.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    db.SetCombineAndStore(SetOperation.Union, allUsersSet, new RedisKey[]{activeUsersSet, inactiveUsersSet, offlineUsersSet});
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Check Membership</h2>

<p>
    Sets do not allow duplication, but they allow very rapid O(1) membership checks. So if we 
    wanted to check to see if <span class="code">User:6</span> is offline we could do so very easily:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var user6Offline = db.SetContains(offlineUsersSet, "User:6");
    Console.WriteLine($"User:6 offline: {user6Offline}");
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Enumerate Set</h2>

<p>
    When you want to enumerate the members of a set, you have two options: you can enumerate
    them all in one shot, or you can scan over the set and enumerate everything. We'll go
    over how to do each of those here.
</p>

<h3>Enumerate Entire Set</h3>

<p>
    If you want to guarantee that you are enumerating the entire set in one round trip, 
    you can do so by using the <span class="code">SetMembers</span> method. This will use the <span class="code">SMEMBERS</span> 
    command in Redis. If your set is relatively compact (under 1000 members), this is a
    perfectly valid way to pull back all of your set members.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    Console.WriteLine($"All Users In one shot: {string.Join(", ", db.SetMembers(allUsersSet))}");
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Enumerate Set in Chunks</h3>

<p>
    The alternate way to enumerate a set is to enumerate it with <span class="code">SetScan</span>, which will
    create a Set Enumerator, and use the <span class="code">SSCAN</span> command to scan over the entire set until
    the set is exhausted.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    Console.WriteLine($"All Users with scan  : {string.Join(", ", db.SetScan(allUsersSet))}");
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Move Elements Between Sets</h2>

<p>
    A very normal operation you might need to perform with sets is to move elements between
    them. For example if <span class="code">User:1</span> were to move offline, you can use <span class="code">SetMove</span>
    to move them from the active user set to the offline user set.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    Console.WriteLine("Moving User:1 from active to offline");
    var moved = db.SetMove(activeUsersSet, offlineUsersSet, "User:1");
    Console.WriteLine($"Move Successful: {moved}");
</pre>
</p>
