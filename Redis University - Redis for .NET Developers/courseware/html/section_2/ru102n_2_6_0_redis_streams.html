<h1>Redis Streams</h1>

<p>
    Redis Streams are an append-only log like data structure that allows you to enqueue messages from producers to be consumed by consumers in
    your application. They are a powerful data structure with a rich feature set, and for a full explanation as to how and why to use Redis Streams,
    you can checkout <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://university.redis.com/courses/ru202/">RU202: Redis Streams.</a>
</p>

<p>
    In this section, we'll explore using Redis Streams in .NET using the StackExchange.Redis library. We'll learn how to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Add Messages to a Stream.</li>
    <li>Read Messages from a Stream.</li>
    <li>Read Messages from a Stream in a Consumer Group.</li>    
</ul>

<h2>Stream Limitations in StackExchange.Redis</h2>

<p>
    Due to the multiplexed nature of StackExchange.Redis, it's important to note at the top that there is no mechanism for using the blocking
    paradigms available within the stream reading operations. 
</p>
<p>
    This means that the Stream Read operations, <span class="code">StreamRead</span> & <span class="code">StreamReadGroup</span>, will
    not be able to use the <span class="code">XREAD</span> and <span class="code">XREADGROUP</span> block timer or the special <span class="code"><i>$</i></span> id to read only new messages.
