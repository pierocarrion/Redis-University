<h1>Redis Sets</h1>

<p>
    Redis Sets are an implementation of a <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)">mathematical set</a>.
    Like mathematical sets they have a number of key properties:    
</p>

<ul>
    <li>They are unordered.</li>
    <li>They do not allow duplication, so there are no repeated members.</li>
    <li>They can be combined together to create new sets.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In this section we'll learn about how to leverage these properties using Redis Sets in .NET.
