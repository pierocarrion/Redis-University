<h1>Hands-On with Redis Sorted Sets in .NET</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On we'll be exploring how to use Redis Sorted Sets from StackExchange.Redis.
    You can either create your own project to follow along with and connect a multiplexer,
    or you can open <span class="code">/src/section_2/section2.4/section2.4.csproj</span> in your IDE.
</p>

<p>
    To illustrate the usage of Sorted Sets, we'll be using five sets. Four of them will be
    connected under the same domain, <span class="code"><i>users:age</i></span>, <span class="code"><i>users:lastAccess</i></span>, <span class="code"><i>users:highScores</i></span>, <span class="code"><i>users:mostRecentlyActive</i></span>,
    and we'll have one set <span class="code"><i>names</i></span> to demonstrate lexicographic ordering. First let's start
    by purging all these sets, that way we can run this repeatedly without any other preamble.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var userAgeSet = "users:age";
    var userLastAccessSet = "users:lastAccess";
    var userHighScoreSet = "users:highScores";
    var namesSet = "names";
    var mostRecentlyActive = "users:mostRecentlyActive";

    db.KeyDelete(new RedisKey[]{userAgeSet, userLastAccessSet, userHighScoreSet, namesSet, mostRecentlyActive});
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Populate Sets</h2>

<p>
    Now that we've cleared everything out, we can populate the sets. We'll add six members
    to each set. To add an item to a set you will add a <span class="code">SortedSetEntry</span>, which
    is a member name and score. Because these commands are variadic, we will be passing in
    arrays of <span class="code">SortedSetEntry</span>. For our purposes, we will set users with Id 1-6, for our users
    sets, and then for our names set, we will add an arbitrary set of names. For our user sets
    we'll provide scores that are relevant for the key, and importantly for the names set.
    Which we intend to sort lexicographically, we will provide a score of 0.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    db.SortedSetAdd(userAgeSet,
        new SortedSetEntry[]
        {
            new("User:1", 20),
            new("User:2", 23),
            new("User:3", 18),
            new("User:4", 35),
            new("User:5", 55),
            new("User:6", 62)
        });
        
    db.SortedSetAdd(userLastAccessSet,
        new SortedSetEntry[]
        {
            new("User:1", 1648483867),
            new("User:2", 1658074397),
            new("User:3", 1659132660),
            new("User:4", 1652082765),
            new("User:5", 1658087415),
            new("User:6", 1656530099)
        });
        
    db.SortedSetAdd(userHighScoreSet,
        new SortedSetEntry[]
        {
            new("User:1", 10),
            new("User:2", 55),
            new("User:3", 36),
            new("User:4", 25),
            new("User:5", 21),
            new("User:6", 44)
        });
        
    db.SortedSetAdd(namesSet,
        new SortedSetEntry[]
        {
            new("John", 0),
            new("Fred", 0),
            new("Bob", 0),
            new("Susan", 0),
            new("Alice", 0),
            new("Tom", 0)
        });
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Check Score</h2>

<p>
    To check a score of a member, simply use <span class="code">SortedSetScore</span> passing in the key name
    and the user id.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var user3HighScore = db.SortedSetScore(userHighScoreSet, "User:3");
    Console.WriteLine($"User:3 High Score: {user3HighScore}");  
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Check Rank</h2>

<p>
    To check a user's rank, you can use the <span class="code">SortedSetRank</span> method. With this method you can pass in the key, the User Id, and a 
    direction that you want the sorting to be done in. In this case, when we say "Rank" we mean we want the high score coming up first. Hence
    we'll use the <span class="code">Descending</span> direction.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var user2Rank = db.SortedSetRank(userHighScoreSet, "User:2", Order.Descending);
    Console.WriteLine($"User:2 Rank: {user2Rank}");
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Range Queries</h2>

<p>
    Probably the most popular way to query members from a stream is by using the "Range" methods. There are three ways that you can run ranges
    on a sorted set.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>By Rank</li>
    <li>By Score</li>
    <li>By Lex</li>
</ul>

<p>
    There are also several other options that you can add to these queries to change the directions of these ranges, to determine whether you
    will get the scores along with the members, and finally to decide whether you want to store the output of the range, rather than pulling
    the members back in one shot.
</p>

<h3>Range By Rank</h3>

<p>
    Ranging over a sorted set by rank is the default method for ranges with sorted sets. In the case of a range by rank, there are only three things
    you need to know:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>What rank do you want to start at?</li>
    <li>What rank do you want to stop at?</li>
    <li>What direction do you want the set to be sorted in?</li>
</ol>

<p>
   With this information it's straightforward to start ranging over your sorted sets by rank, just use the <span class="code">SortedSetRange</span> command
   passing in the relevant arguments. Let's try printing out the three highest scorers. To do this, we'll just go from index zero to two, and
   order the sorted set descending:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var topThreeScores = db.SortedSetRangeByRank(userHighScoreSet, 0, 2, Order.Descending);
    Console.WriteLine($"Top three: {string.Join(", ", topThreeScores)}");
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Range By Score</h2>

<p>
    Ranging a Sorted Set by Score is also pretty straightforward. There are two major differences:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>You are using the member's score rather than their rank within the set.</li>
    <li>You have to decide whether you want the scores you are using to be inclusive or exclusive.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    With that decided, you can use the <span class="code">SortedSetRangeByScore</span> method to range over your sorted set. Let's find all the users between
    18 and 30 inclusively with their ages, since we want to pull back the ages as well, we will use the <span class="code">SortedSetRangeByScoreWithScores</span> method.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var eighteenToThirty = db.SortedSetRangeByScoreWithScores(userAgeSet, 18, 30, Exclude.None);
    Console.WriteLine($"Users between 18 and 30: {string.Join(", ", eighteenToThirty)}");
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Lexicographic Ranges</h2>

<p>
    When all the scores within a sorted set are set to the same score, traditionally 0, there is a lexicographic ordering mechanic available.
    If you wanted to alphabetize all of the names in our names sorted set, all you would have to do is use the <span class="code">SortedSetRangeByValue</span> 
    method:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var namesAlphabetized = db.SortedSetRangeByValue(namesSet);
    Console.WriteLine($"Names Alphabetized: {string.Join(",",namesAlphabetized)}");
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    If you wanted to find a proper alphabetic range, for example, all the names that start with between an "A" and "J", you can do that as well,
    these comparisons will be based off ASCII encoding and will be based off what <span class="code">memcmp</span> returns. The Sorted Sets section of RU101 has a rich,
    detailed view as to how this works exactly. But for our purposes here, if we want to find all the names that start with between "A" and "J",
    we'd actually want to end with an exclusive "K" at the end like so:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var namesBetweenAandJ = db.SortedSetRangeByValue(namesSet, "A", "K", Exclude.Stop);
    Console.WriteLine($"Names between A and J: {string.Join(", ", namesBetweenAandJ)}");
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Combining Sorted Sets</h2>

<p>
    We can also combine sorted sets together to help us answer more interesting questions. Say for example we wanted to find the three most
    recently active players, and then determine the rank order of those three by high score. Well, we have an unpopulated as of yet sorted set
    <span class="code"><i>users:mostRecentlyActive</i></span> that we can populate using the <span class="code">SortedSetRangeAndStore</span> method:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    db.SortedSetRangeAndStore(userLastAccessSet,mostRecentlyActive,  0, 2, order: Order.Descending);
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    With that done, we can use the intersection sorted set operation to find the intersection between the most recently active players, and the
    player scores set. We can then weight the high score to 1, and the last access time to 0, producing only the high score. This will return
    the players and their scores in ascending order, but we can reverse this easily with a call to <span class="code">Reverse</span> at the end.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var rankOrderMostRecentlyActive = db.SortedSetCombineWithScores(SetOperation.Intersect, new RedisKey[]{userHighScoreSet, mostRecentlyActive}, new double[]{1,0}).Reverse();
    Console.WriteLine($"Highest Scores Most Recently Active: {string.Join(", ", rankOrderMostRecentlyActive)}");
</pre>
</p>
