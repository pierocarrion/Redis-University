<h1>Redis Pub/Sub</h1>

<p>
    <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/docs/manual/pubsub/">Pub/Sub</a> allows for a subscriber to listen for events on channels in Redis using the
    Publisher/Subscriber messaging pattern. 
</p>
<p>
    Pub/Sub is unique in StackExchange.Redis as it is the only thing the library does that is not
    on the main interactive connection. Earlier in the course I mentioned that StackExchange.Redis opens two connection to Redis at a time.
</p>
<p>
    The first of these is the interactive connection that you use to send all of your interactive commands to Redis on. The other is the subscriber
    connection. There's a really good reason for this, after subscribing to a channel in Redis, Redis flips the connection over to Subscriber
    mode which does not allow any non pub/sub related commands across, allowing it to send messages back to the client unhindered by other 
    traffic on the channel.

    In this section, we'll be learning how to use the pub/sub API in StackExchange.Redis. How to subscribe to channels, and handle messages
    that are dispatched from Redis to the client.
