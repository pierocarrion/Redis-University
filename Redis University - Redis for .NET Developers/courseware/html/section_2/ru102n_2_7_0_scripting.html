<h1>Scripting in StackExchange.Redis</h1>

<p>
    StackExchange.Redis exposes the Redis <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/docs/manual/programmability/eval-intro/">Lua Scripting</a> API. This allows
    you to run multiple commands on the Redis server in sequence, and use the intermediate results of those commands within the context of the script.
</p>
<p> Since
    Redis is single threaded, and each command within Redis executes in isolation, we can leverage Redis Scripts to handle some thorny problems
    where we might need to use the result of one command in another command.
</p>

<p>
    Getting fully into the weeds of Lua Scripting is outside the scope of this course. There's good coverage of this topic in 
    <a class="page-link" target="_blank" href="https://university.redis.com/courses/ru101/">RU101 Introduction to Redis Data Structures</a> if you want to learn more. But for
    the purposes of this course. We'll simply be discussing how to work with the Lua Scripts in the context of StackExchange.Redis.
</p>

<h2>Prepared Scripts</h2>

<p>
    Prepared scripts are the preferred way to interact with scripting in StackExchange.Redis. Prepared scripts tend to be more readable than
    their unprepared compatriots, because they allow for argument substitution rather than leaning heavily on the <span class="code"><i>ARGV</i></span> and <span class="code"><i>KEYS</i></span> 
    arrays to pass in arguments and keys to the script. 
</p>
<p>
    Prepared scripts are also registered with the library's internal script cache. This 
    tracks which scripts have been registered with which servers, and handles automatic retries of scripts after a server's script cache has 
    been cleared. In other words, the prepared script API removes a lot of the complexity from using Lua scripts in Redis. In this section 
    we'll briefly go over how to Prepare, run, and use the results from a script.
