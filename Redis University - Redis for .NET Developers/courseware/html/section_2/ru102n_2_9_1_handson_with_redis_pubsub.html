<h1>Hands-On with Redis Pub/Sub</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On, we'll be exploring how to use Redis Pub/Sub from StackExchange.Redis.
    You can either create your own project to follow along with and connect a multiplexer,
    or you can open <span class="code">/src/section_2/section2.9/section2.9.csproj</span> in your IDE.
</p>

<h2>Get an ISubscriber</h2>
<p>
    In addition to the <span class="code">IDatabase</span> instance that we've needed in most other examples in this course, we'll also need to grab an 
    instance of an <span class="code">ISubscriber</span>, to get one, we'll simply need to call <span class="code">ConnectionMultiplexer.GetSubscriber</span>. We'll
    have a cancellation token source so we can cut off our producer tasks when it's time, so let's also initialize that.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var subscriber = muxer.GetSubscriber();
    var cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
    var token = cancellationTokenSource.Token;
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Sequential vs Concurrent</h2>

<h3>Simple Sequential</h3>
<p>
    When working with the subscriber, there's a decision you need to make, you can either process messages sequentially or concurrently.
    If you need your messages delivered in order, you're going to want to use the sequential delivery mechanism. If you do not pass a delegate
    to the <span class="code">Subscribe</span> method, it produces a channel object that you can listen to messages on.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var channel = await subscriber.SubscribeAsync("test-channel");

    channel.OnMessage(msg =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Sequentially received: {msg.Message} on channel: {msg.Channel}");
    });
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Simple Concurrent</h2>

<p>
    To listen to messages concurrently, you need only pass a delegate into the <span class="code">Subscribe</span> method. That delegate takes two arguments,
    the channel the message was sent to, and the message itself.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    await subscriber.SubscribeAsync("test-channel", (channel, value) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Received: {value} on channel: {channel}");
    });
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Create the Producer</h3>
<p>
    After we've subscribed, we can set up a task to repeatedly send messages to our channel over and over again, and we'll throw a 
    <span class="code">Console.ReadKey</span> at the end, so that we can stop the app with any key. This will produce messages that will appear to both
    subscriptions, given that they are separate subscribers insofar as StackExchange.Redis is concerned. However because of the multiplexed
    nature of StackExchange.Redis, Redis will only see one subscriber.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var basicSendTask = Task.Run(async () =>
    {
        var i = 0;
        while (!token.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            await db.PublishAsync("test-channel", i++);
            await Task.Delay(1000);
        }
    });

    // put all other producer/subscriber stuff above here.
    Console.ReadKey();
    // put cancellation & unsubscribe down here.
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Subscribe to Pattern</h2>

<p>
    The Pub/Sub API allows you to also subscribe to channel patterns, using simple glob patterns. This is basically the only difference
    between subscribing to patterns vs not subscribing to patterns.
</p>
<p>
    If you wanted to subscribe to the prefix <i>pattern:</i>, you'd simply
    need to make the pattern <span class="code"><i>pattern:*</i></span>, then whenever you send any message to a channel matching that pattern, it will be picked up.
    So let's also add a producer that will publish to channels matching that pattern with random GUIDs.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var patternSendTask = Task.Run(async () =>
    {
        var i = 0;
        while (!token.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            await db.PublishAsync($"pattern:{Guid.NewGuid()}", i++);
            await Task.Delay(1000);
        }
    });
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Unsubscribe</h2>

<p>
    Now that we've subscribed to our channels, the last thing to do is to unsubscribe. Let's take a look at how to do this in stages.    
</p>

<h3>Unsubscribe from Sequential Channel</h3>

<p>
    We can unsubscribe from the sequential channel we created earlier by calling <span class="code">Unsubscribe</span> on the channel object. We'll add another
    <span class="code"><code>Console.ReadKey</code></span> after this so that we can observe that the channel stops producing messages.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    Console.WriteLine("Unsubscribing to a single channel");
    await channel.UnsubscribeAsync();
    Console.ReadKey();
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Unsubscribe Concurrent Subscriber</h3>

<p>
    To unsubscribe from the subscriber that was running concurrently, we just need to call <span class="code">Unsubscribe</span> on the subscriber, this will
    unsubscribe for all channels and delegates listening to that channel, so if we had done this before our sequential unsubscribe it would
    have been unsubscribed as well.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    Console.WriteLine("Unsubscribing whole subscriber from test-channel");
    await subscriber.UnsubscribeAsync("test-channel");
    Console.ReadKey();
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Unsubscribe from Everything</h3>

<p>
    If you need to unsubscribe from everything, just call <span class="code">UnsubscribeAll</span>, and it will cut off all subscriptions to Redis.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    Console.WriteLine("Unsubscribing from all");
    await subscriber.UnsubscribeAllAsync();
    Console.ReadKey();
</pre>
</p>
