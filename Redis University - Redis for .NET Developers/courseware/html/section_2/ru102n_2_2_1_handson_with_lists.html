<h1>Hands-On with Redis Lists</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On we'll be exploring how to use Redis Lists from StackExchange.Redis.
    You can either create your own project to follow along with and connect a multiplexer,
    or you can open <span class="code">/src/section_2/section2.2/section2.2.csproj</span> in your IDE.
</p>

<p>
    We'll be exploring lists using two lists of strings, fruits and vegetables. So, now that
    we have our multiplexer initialized and we have a handle to the <span class="code">IDatabase</span>, our first task
    is to clean out any prior list, so we start each program run with a clean slate.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    var fruitKey = "fruits";
    var vegetableKey = "vegetables";
    db.KeyDelete(new RedisKey[] { fruitKey, vegetableKey });
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Pushing to Lists</h2>

<p>
    Lists are doubly linked lists, meaning you can push or pop from 
    either side of the list. However, any sort of indexed access becomes
    an O(N) operation where N is the the number of elements you need to
    traverse to reach the index. Let's start out by pushing.
</p>

<h3>Push Left</h3>
<p>
    Let's push some fruit to the left side of the list. Each time we push a fruit
    to the left, we are adding that fruit to the head of the list.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    db.ListLeftPush(fruitKey, new RedisValue[]{"Banana", "Mango", "Apple", "Pepper", "Kiwi", "Grape"});
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Now let's try printing out the first element in this list. Lists are indexed left to right,
    consequentially the last fruit that we pushed left, will be the 0th index "Grape":
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    Console.WriteLine($"The first fruit in the list is: {db.ListGetByIndex(fruitKey, 0)}");
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    And if we accessed the tail of the list, with the index -1, we'd get the first element
    we pushed into the left side of the list, "Banana":
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    Console.WriteLine($"The last fruit in the list is:  {db.ListGetByIndex(fruitKey, -1)}");
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Push Right</h4>
<p>
    In our vegetable list, we'll now push right. Since we are pushing right, the item in
    question is added to the tail of the list, making it the last element in the list if we
    iterate over the list.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    db.ListRightPush(vegetableKey, new RedisValue[]{"Potato", "Carrot", "Asparagus", "Beet", "Garlic", "Tomato"});
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Now if we try to access the first element in the vegetable list, we'll get the first
    element that we pushed to the right, "Potato".
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    Console.WriteLine($"The first vegetable in the list is: {db.ListGetByIndex(vegetableKey, 0)}");
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Conversely if we access the last element, we'll get "Tomato" - which is not a vegetable at all!
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    Console.WriteLine($"The last vegetable in the list is:  {db.ListGetByIndex(vegetableKey, -1)}");
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Enumerate a List</h2>

<p>
    To enumerate a list, you can use the <span class="code">ListRange</span> method. If you pass in a start
    index, the range will start from there, and if you pass in a stop index, it will stop there,
    if you pass in neither a start nor a stop, it will pull back the whole list.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    Console.WriteLine($"Fruit indexes 0 to -1: {string.Join(", ", db.ListRange(fruitKey))}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Vegetables index 0 to -2: {string.Join(", ", db.ListRange(vegetableKey, 0, -2))}");
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Move elements Between Lists</h2>

<p>
    You can also transfer elements between lists using the <span class="code">ListMove</span> method
    This accepts two list keys, as well as the source side and destination side. These are 
    the sides of the list you will pop from and push to respectively. Let's transfer "Tomato"
    from our vegetable list to our fruit list, since it's in fact a fruit and not a vegetable.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    db.ListMove(vegetableKey, fruitKey, ListSide.Right, ListSide.Left);
</pre>
</p>

<h2>List as a Queue</h2>

<p>
    You can user a Redis List as a defacto FIFO Queue by pushing and popping from
    different sides. Conventionally you'd push left, pop right:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    Console.WriteLine("Enqueuing Celery");
    db.ListLeftPush(vegetableKey, "Celery");
    Console.WriteLine($"Dequeued: {db.ListRightPop(vegetableKey)}");
</pre>
</p>

<h2>List as a Stack</h2>

<p>
    You can also get your lists to act as LIFO stacks, by pushing and popping from the same,
    by convention you'd typically use the left side.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    Console.WriteLine("Pushing Grapefruit");
    db.ListLeftPush(fruitKey, "Grapefruit");
    Console.WriteLine($"Popping Fruit: {string.Join(",", db.ListLeftPop(fruitKey, 2))}");
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Searching Lists</h2>
<p>
    Redis Lists also allow you to find the index of a particular item using the <span class="code">ListPosition</span>
    method.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    Console.WriteLine($"Position of Mango: {db.ListPosition(fruitKey, "Mango")}");
</pre>
</p>

<h2>List Size</h2>

<p>
    And finally, you use the <span class="code">ListLength</span> method to determine the size of a given list.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
    Console.WriteLine($"There are {db.ListLength(fruitKey)} fruits in our Fruit List");
</pre>
</p>
